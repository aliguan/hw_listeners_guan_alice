* Why couldn’t I put form.addEventListener, but instead had to put the id for the form in problem 5??

* For problem 5, I was able to understand that I needed to use document.getElementById, but I used w3schools extensively to find the .elements.namedItem() function. I understood that I need to use that code to find the value of the input field, but is there another way to know how to find that other than knowing that it’s a preset function in the API? (Hope that question makes sense)
